# UdaciCards Project

This is the code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

It's a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Install and Run

Install dependencies running the following command:

```
npm install
```

then run the app on a remote device or emulators 

```
expo start
```
